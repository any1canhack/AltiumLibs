AltiumLibs
==========

Component libraries for use with Altium.

Simple rules for putting parts in: 

1.  Every part has pulled information from digikey site (supplier search) for part
2.  Every part has 3D body associated with it

Resistor0603 and Resistor0402 are complete sets (~120 values each).
Other categories are relatively sparse, but I expect them grow organically with new designs that need new parts.

These libraries are not guaranteed correct, so please check closely if you use one of the components.
